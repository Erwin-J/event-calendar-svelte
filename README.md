# Svelte Event Calendar

This project is done as part of the Exploration Days @ Cegeka.
Exploring the Svelte framework while in the progress of creating a calendar.

**Currently done:**
* Basic calendar view (days per month, switch month)
* Click on a date for event creation popup (not able to plan events yet)
* Show events on the calendar as example

Please note that no optimization is done yet as this is for learning purposes.
